Run `npm i` to install server-side dependencies (socket.io and express) and then `node server` to run the server.

The core game code is all on the client side. The server is a thin wrapper around [socket.io][io] to proxy messages to all clients in the same room.

[io]: https://socket.io/

The client side is implemented in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) + [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) with hooks. All client-side code is in the index.html file. There is no client-side build step.

Players give their names when they arrive, and then appear in the lobby.
